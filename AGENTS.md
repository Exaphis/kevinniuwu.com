# AGENTS

This repo is a personal site built with Astro and Tailwind. Use pnpm for all package scripts.

## Quick commands
- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev server: `pnpm dev`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Preview: `pnpm preview`

## Project notes
- Source code lives in `src/`.
- Static assets live in `public/`.
- Avoid editing `dist/` by hand; it is build output.

## Code style
- Keep edits minimal and consistent with existing patterns.
- Prefer simple, readable components over clever abstractions.
