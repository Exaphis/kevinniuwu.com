The washers and dryers at my apartment complex cost an outrageous \$1.85 per wash
and another \$1.85 per dry.

Almost \$4 per laundry trip? _In this economy?_

Fortunately, this poster is hung up in the laundry room:

Let's see if we can get free laundry out of this, shall we?

## Investigating the referral system

Once we download the app and sign up with a new account, we can click the "Get Free
Laundry" tab on the sidebar and get sent to this page:

So we can get free money by referring someone! Testing this manually shows that it works,
but there's some kind of detection for accounts created on the same device.

Let's see how this works in the app's code. Maybe we can find a way to create accounts
automatically.

## Decompiling the app

```
$ jadx --show-bad-code --deobf --deobf-use-sourcename \
  --deobf-parse-kotlin-metadata cscpay_2.16.1.apk
INFO  - loading ...
INFO  - processing ...
ERROR - finished with errors, count: 9
```

With everything decompiled by [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx),
we can open it up in Android Studio and poke around.

Conveniently, in `ApiInterface.java`, we can find an interface for all the API calls that
the app makes (thanks to them using [retrofit2](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)).

## Signing up

Using an emulator and [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), we can see that the app makes a POST request
to `api/auth/register_device_check` upon signup.

```java
@POST("api/auth/register_device_check")
Call<NormalResponse> registeCommrWithEmail(@Header("X-API-KEY") String str, @Body Map<String, String> map);
```

Let's see where `registeCommrWithEmail`, the interface function that makes this request, is called in the code.

```java
setBgAndText(this.mEmail, 2, this.llEmail, this.tipEmail, this.imageEmail, "Email");
setBgAndText(this.mPassword, 2, this.llPassword, this.tipPassword, this.imagePassword, "Password");
AnalyticsUtil.email(this, str);
AnalyticsUtil.regSubmit(this, str, str2, Constants.STANDARD, Constants.NewLogin);
HashMap hashMap = new HashMap();
hashMap.put("email", str);
hashMap.put("password", str2);
hashMap.put("confirm_password", str2);
hashMap.put("sitecode", AppConfig.SITE_CODE);
hashMap.put(Constants.LOCATION_CODE, AppConfig.LOCATION_CODE);
hashMap.put("app_type", "2");
hashMap.put("referring_uid", AppConfig.referring_uid);
hashMap.put("app_token", AppConfig.uniqueID);
LoadingDialog.show(this, "Creating Account");
WbApiModule.registeCommrWithEmail(new C10725(str, str2), hashMap);
```

What are the parameters put in the hashmap?

`app_token` might be the device ID. Investigating further, we see that `AppConfig.uniqueID`
is set to a UUID generated from `Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID`. [This is a unique constant
for each device (almost)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43393373).
When we create our new accounts, let's make sure to generate a new UUID for each one.

From looking at the network requests, `sitecode` and `location_code` are constants identifying
the apartment complex and the specific laundry room within it. We can set these to some dummy
values found by looking at the network requests when registering an account after choosing a random
apartment/laundry room.

`referring_uid` is the only thing left that we need. How can we get our user ID?

## Logging in

The app makes a POST request to `api/auth/login` when we log in.

```java
@Headers({"Content-Type: application/json", "Cache-Control: no-cache"})
@POST("api/auth/login")
Call<SigninResponse> signin(@Header("X-API-KEY") String str, @Body Map<String, String> map);
```

Following the same process as before, the interface function `signIn`
that makes the request is called in `SigninFormActivity.java`.

```java
private void signinRequest(String str, String str2) {
    AnalyticsUtil.loginAttempt(this.mContext, str, Constants.STANDARD);
    HashMap hashMap = new HashMap();
    hashMap.put(FirebaseAnalytics.Event.LOGIN, str);
    hashMap.put("password", str2);
    emailStr = str;
    pwdStr = str2;
    AppConfig.USER_EMAIL = "";
    if (WbApiModule.signinRequest(this.signinCallback, hashMap)) {
        return;
    }
    this.progressBar.setVisibility(8);
}
```

Tracing back, `str` is the email address and `str2` is the password.

## Referring a user

Finally, we can see that the app makes a POST request to `api/referral/set_referred_mark` when we
say we've been referred. You know the drill.

```java
@FormUrlEncoded
@POST("api/referral/set_referred_mark")
Call<ResponseBody> setReferredMark(@Header("X-API-KEY") String str, @Field("token") String str2, @Field("user_id") String str3);
```

```java
public static void setReferredMark(Callback<ResponseBody> callback) {
    LogUtils.m101i("Retrofit", "setReferredMark...");
    ((ApiInterface) retrofit.create(ApiInterface.class)).setReferredMark(AppConfig.WASHBOARD_KEY, AppConfig.USER_TOKEN, AppConfig.USER_ID).enqueue(callback);
}
```

`AppConfig.USER_TOKEN` and `AppConfig.USER_ID` are set when we log in.

## API details

### What is the base URL?

Easy. It's set to `AppConfig.WASHBOARD_URL`, which is set to https://digitalinsights.cscsw.com:443/.

### What is X-API-KEY?

Each request requires a header `X-API-KEY`, which is set to `AppConfig.WASHBOARD_KEY`.
It's set to the response of this function:

```java
@Headers({"Cache-Control: no-cache"})
@GET("api/security/api_key")
Call<WashboardKeyResponse> getNewApiKey(@Header("Authorization") String str, @Query("vendor_id") String str2);
```

`str` is the authorization token, which is set to `AppConfig.NEW_HEADER_AUTH2`, which is... hardcoded to `Basic YWRtaW46OTMxNQ==`.
wtf? the username and password is just "admin" and "9314"?

`str2` is the vendor ID, which is set to `AppConfig.VENDOR_ID`, which is always set to `20806`??

## Putting it all together

1. Get our own user ID by sending a request to the login endpoint with our email and password.
2. Create a new account with our own user ID as the `referring_uid` parameter.
3. Mark the new account as referred by sending a request to the referral endpoint with the new user's ID and token.
4. ???
5. Profit!
