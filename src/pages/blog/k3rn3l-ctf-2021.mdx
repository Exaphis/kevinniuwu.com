Over Nov 12-13, 2021, I played in K3RN3LCTF as part of [b01lers](https://b01lers.com/).

Thanks to drdoctor for the fun challenge and K3RN3LARMY for hosting the CTF!

## Challenge description

I was trying to sort using Bogosort, but it was taking a while, so in the meantime I made this challenge. Enjoy!

`nc ctf.k3rn3l4rmy.com 2237`

Attached: [main.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kasimir123/K3RN3LCTF-2021/main/server-files/BogoAttack/main.py)

## Goal

The server has a randomly shuffled array of 10,000 numbers taking on eachvalue between 0 and 9,999.
The goal is to **guess the entire array of numbers**.

You are able to **steal numbers** at any indices of the array.
If you send a list of indices to the server,
it will return the list of numbers that are at those indices in the shuffled array.

However, the numbers returned are themselves shuffled - **you don't know which numbers are at which index!**

You can perform at most **14** steals before guessing the array. There's only one chance to guess all of the numbers.

Sample interaction with server:

```
Enter (1) to steal and (2) to guess: 1
Enter numbers to steal: 0 1
Stolen: [5423, 4664]
Enter (1) to steal and (2) to guess: 1
Enter numbers to steal: 0 1
Stolen: [4664, 5423]
Enter (1) to steal and (2) to guess: 2
What is the list: 0 1 2 3 4 5
NOPE
```

Even though we steal the same two indices both times,
the numbers returned to us are not in the same order. We can't infer which index contains which number.

## Solution

tl;dr - binary search

The 14 steals we have seems awfully arbitrary, doesn't it?

14 happens to be pretty significant in this context, as log<sub>2</sub>(10000) = 13.2877.
If you've taking programming classes, the log<sub>2</sub> might seem familiar to you -
is this some divide and conquer algorithm like binary search?

Let's walk through some simpler examples and see whether or not we can generalize our
findings to an arbitrarily large array.

### Walkthrough - length 2

Say we have an shuffled array containing two numbers (0 and 1).

How can we guess the order of the array with one steal?

Simple! Just steal the 1st number (or 2nd, doesn't matter).
Once we know the 1st number, we also know the 2nd one must be the one that the server didn't return.

By stealing half of the indices, we reduced the possible numbers that each index could be by half (2 to 1).

### Walkthrough - length 4

Let's level it up to a shuffled array containing four numbers (for example's sake, let it be `[0, 3, 1, 2]`).
Can we guess the order with two steals?

Let's lay out what we know in a table.

| Index | Possible numbers |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 0     | 0, 1, 2, 3       |
| 1     | 0 ,1, 2, 3       |
| 2     | 0 ,1, 2, 3       |
| 3     | 0, 1, 2, 3       |

We can try and halve the possible numbers for each index.

Using the same technique as we used with length 2, let's just steal half the numbers.

```
Enter numbers to steal: 0 1
Stolen: 3 0
```

We know now that indices 0 and 1 must have 3 or 0, and indices 2 and 3 musthave 1 or 2.

| Index | Possible numbers |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 0     | 0, 3             |
| 1     | 0, 3             |
| 2     | 1, 2             |
| 3     | 1, 2             |

We have 2 groups of indices based on their possible numbers: `[0, 1]` both have the same candidates,
and same goes for `[2, 3]`.

For each group, notice that we can do exactly what we did for length 2!
Steal half of the indices, which reduces the possible numbers from 2 to 1.

The process for both groups can be done in **one steal**!

```
Enter numbers to steal: 0 2
Stolen: 0 1
```

Given an index's possible numbers, its possible numbers after the steal are determined by the following:

1. If we stole the index, its new possible numbers will be all the numbers thatwere possible that **WERE**
   returned by the steal. We just stole that index, so its number must be in the response.
2. Otherwise, its new possible numbers will be all the numbers that werepossible that **WERE NOT** returned
   by the steal. That index's number cannot be in the response because we didn't steal that index.

Let's use this process to finalize our table.

| Index | Possible numbers |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 0     | 0                |
| 1     | 3                |
| 2     | 1                |
| 3     | 2                |

In two steals, we have deduced the entire shuffled array of 4 numbers.

With an array of length 8, we can query half of the indices to halve the possible numbers to 4.
Then, we perform the same steps just described for length 4, but across the two halves at the same time.

For an array of length 2, we need 1 steal.

For an array of length 4, we need 2 steals.

For an array of length 8, we need 3 steals.

For an array of length 2<sup>n</sup>, we need n steals.

For an array of length n, we need log<sub>2</sub>(n) steals.

**Exactly the number we have.**

### Script

We have all the intuition we need in order to solve this challenge.

```python
from pwn import *
from collections import defaultdict

class Remote:
    def __init__(self):
        # infra disabled after CTF ended
        # self.conn = remote('ctf.k3rn3l4rmy.com', 2247)
        self.conn = process(['python3', 'main.py'])

    def steal(self, idxs):
        """Given a list of indices to steal, return the set of numbers that are in those indices."""
        self.conn.sendline(b'1')
        query_str = ' '.join(map(str, idxs))
        self.conn.sendline(query_str.encode('ascii'))

        self.conn.recvuntil(b'Stolen: [')
        resp = self.conn.recvuntilS(b']')[:-1]
        return set(map(int, resp.split(', ')))

    def guess(self, nums):
        """Guess the given list of numbers and return the server's response."""
        self.conn.sendline(b'2')
        self.conn.sendline(' '.join(map(str, nums)))
        self.conn.recvuntil(b'What is the list: ')
        return self.conn.recvlineS().strip()

def main():
    LEN = 10**4
    r = Remote()

    # for each index i of the list, candidates[i] is the set of numbers it could possibly be
    candidates = [frozenset(range(LEN))] * LEN

    # repeat while we have any indices with more than one possible number
    while any(len(s) > 1 for s in candidates):
        print('Maximum candidate set size:', max(map(len, candidates)))

        # find the sets of indexes that have the same candidate set

        # this allows us to halve the length of each candidate set by
        # querying half of the indexes for each candidate set

        groups = defaultdict(list)
        for i, cand_set in enumerate(candidates):
            groups[cand_set].append(i)

        # steal half of the indexes for each group
        query = set()
        for idxs in groups.values():
            query.update(idxs[::2])

        resp_set = r.steal(query)

        # if the index was queried: its number will be in the response.
        # therefore, its new candidate set is the intersection of its old one and the response.

        # otherwise: its number must not be in the response.
        # its new candidate set are the numbers that are in the old candidate
        # set but not in the response. this is the set difference.

        for i in range(LEN):
            if i in query:
                candidates[i] &= resp_set
            else:
                candidates[i] -= resp_set

    # all indices have only one candidate number;
    # we know the list.
    deduced = [list(s)[0] for s in candidates]
    print(r.guess(deduced))

main()
```

Output:

```
Maximum candidate set size: 10000
Maximum candidate set size: 5000
Maximum candidate set size: 2500
Maximum candidate set size: 1250
Maximum candidate set size: 625
Maximum candidate set size: 313
Maximum candidate set size: 157
Maximum candidate set size: 79
Maximum candidate set size: 40
Maximum candidate set size: 20
Maximum candidate set size: 10
Maximum candidate set size: 5
Maximum candidate set size: 3
Maximum candidate set size: 2

```

### Script - gotta go faster

After the CTF ended, I was unsatisfied with my solution - the script takes ~9 seconds to run!
There must be a faster way.

As it turns out, most of the time is spent computing the set intersections and differences
for the candidates. This takes a long time when the candidates are large.

However, most of the time, the candidates are the same for multiple indices!

Instead of calculating the intersection/difference for each index, we can group indices based
on their candidates and calculate the set intersection/difference twice per group -
an intersection for the stolen indices, and a difference for the unstolen ones.

Let's do that to speed up our solve script.

```python
from pwn import *
from collections import defaultdict

class Remote:
    # same as previous, hiding to save space
    pass

def main():
    LEN = 10**4
    r = Remote()

    # each entry into the layer dict is:
    #   set of indices -> set of possible candidates for those indices )
    layer = {frozenset(range(LEN)): frozenset(range(LEN))}

    # if the length of the layer is LEN, then we must have 1 candidate per set
    # and the set must contain only one number
    while len(layer) < LEN:
        # for each set of indices (call them group) in the layer, steal half of them
        # keep track of the stolen and unstolen sets of indices
        stolen_groups = []
        unstolen_groups = []

        for group in layer:
            stolen_idxs = frozenset(list(group)[::2])
            unstolen_idxs = group - stolen_idxs

            stolen_groups.append(stolen_idxs)
            unstolen_groups.append(unstolen_idxs)

        to_steal = [idx for group in stolen_groups for idx in group]
        resp_set = r.steal(to_steal)

        # the new layer will be keyed by the stolen/unstolen groups
        # same logic as previous solution
        new_layer = {}
        for i, group in enumerate(layer):
            # the stolen/unstolen groups could be empty, but that's not a problem
            candidates = layer[group]
            new_layer[stolen_groups[i]] = candidates & resp_set
            new_layer[unstolen_groups[i]] = candidates - resp_set

        layer = new_layer

    # we now have only one candidate per group
    # and each group has only one index
    deduced = []
    for i in range(LEN):
        candidate_set = layer[frozenset([i])]
        deduced.append(list(candidate_set)[0])

    print(r.guess(deduced))

main()
```

Now this only takes 0.26 seconds.

Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed my thought process and approach for this challenge.
