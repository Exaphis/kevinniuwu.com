While developing [NYTogether](https://github.com/Exaphis/nytogether), I've been looking at the New York Times crossword
internals fairly extensively. During development, I noticed one weird flag in the user data structure -
`inShortzMode`. A cute homage to longtime crossword editor [Will Shortz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Shortz), but what is it?

Turns out I found a New York Times Games debugging feature! There's been [one inquisitive person who has discovered this previously in the Spelling Bee](https://old.reddit.com/r/NYTSpellingBee/comments/iovlmy/). But the "Shortz mode" feature also exists in the Crossword, Strands, and Connections games. Let's figure out what Shortz mode does in each.

## Turning on Shortz mode

The NYT Games website is a single page app built using React. Its game state is managed using React Redux. By installing the
Redux DevTools extension, we're able to peer into the internals of the game:

Next, searching for `shortz` in the Chrome network tab gives us a GET request to `https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/shortz/...`.
I wonder what would happen if you override the request to respond `true` instead of `false`?

Bingo! We've unlocked Shortz mode.

## Shortz mode in the Crossword

In the standard Crossword, the first thing different after enabling Shortz mode is edit/view JSON buttons next to the date of the crossword?

Unfortunately, the edit page leads us to a Google sign in page to [nyt.net](https://nyt.net/).

In the settings page, we see a cute icon to turn on/off Shortz mode and some additional debug settings:

- Force gold star eligibility (although this gives a gold star at the end screen, it isn't permanent)
- Speed up sync interval
- Autocheck notice already seen

Finally, there are new 49.9%/74.9%/99.9% options in the "Reveal" tab. We can use these options to cheat by revealing all but the last cell - it doesn't even affect our gold star eligibility!

## Shortz mode in the Spelling Bee

As noted in [this Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/NYTSpellingBee/comments/iovlmy/), enabling Shortz mode allows you to cheat in the Spelling Bee by only typing in the center letter. It will submit new words for as many of the center letter as you typed.

## Shortz mode in Connections

The Shortz mode in Connections has a more stringent check - it also checks that the path name contains `/puzzles/shortz`. I don't know how to get to the puzzle with that path, but we can easily bypass the check by calling `window.history.replaceState({} , 'title', 'https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/shortz');` before starting the game.

In Connections, we now see a "Complete puzzle" button!

## Shortz mode in Strands

The path name check from Connections is also implemented in Strands.

There is now a "Complete" button, which completes the whole puzzle except for the spangram:
