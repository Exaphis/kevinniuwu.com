_The sequel to [Refer, rinse, repeat: doing my laundry for free](/blog/laundry-refer)_

I'm now in a new apartment, and I'm still doing my laundry for free. But this time,
the laundry machine only takes physical laundry cards instead of a phone app.

## Poking around

Near the laundry room, there's a machine that will sell you laundry cards for \$5. After buying
one and trying it out, I noticed that you had to tap the card on the machine once to display your balance,
choose your washer/drying settings, then tap the card again to start the machine. This could mean that the
card is storing some kind of data, and that the machine is writing to it when you tap it the second time.

In that case, the card's balance is not checked by any central server â€” so if we can write to the card ourselves,
then we can make it have any balance we want.

Let's first check what kind of card we're working with.

Looks like it's a Mifare Classic 1k card, which is a type of RFID smart card. I've never worked with RFID before,
so this should be interesting.

After some quick research, it seems like the Mifare Classic 1k is a quite old, and
[quite insecure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE#MIFARE_Classic), card.
A very good sign!

## Cloning the card

The first step to cloning the data is to read it. Using the [MIFARE Classic Tool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.syss.MifareClassicTool&hl=en_US&gl=US)
app, we can try to read the card's data. But, without the right keys, we can't get much.

![A screenshot of MIFARE Classic Tool, showing the first 4 sectors are unreadable](https://i.imgur.com/xjGN5fX.png)

Thus, I set out to buy an NFC card reader online and hook it up to my computer in order to crack the keys. A day later,
with an [ACR122U](https://www.acs.com.hk/en/products/3/acr122u-usb-nfc-reader/) and a new Mifare Classic 1k card
in hand, I was ready to go.

The overview of the process is as follows:

1. Crack the card's keys and dump its data using [mfoc](https://github.com/nfc-tools/mfoc)
2. Write the data to a new card using [libnfc](https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc)'s `nfc-mfclassic` tool

I made sure the new card had a **writable UID** - more on this later.

### Prerequisites

Note: I'm using Manjaro Linux, so the instructions may be slightly different for other distros.

We'll first need to install [libnfc](https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc) and [mfoc](https://github.com/nfc-tools/mfoc).
You should be able to follow the instructions on their respective READMEs.

I had to build libnfc from source in order for it to be able to fully write to the card.
[This seems like a common issue.](https://github.com/nfc-tools/libnfc/issues/564)

To ensure that mfoc detects our self-built libnfc, you need to add `/usr/local/lib` to a file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`.

```shell
$ echo "/usr/local/lib" | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/usrlib.conf
```

Then, run `sudo ldconfig` to update the library cache.

Finally, when running `./configure` for mfoc, you need to also add `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig` to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` variable.

```shell
$ ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
```

At this point, you should be able to run `mfoc` and `nfc-mfclassic` without any issues.
You can test that everything is working by running `nfc-list` while the card is on top of the reader.
If it finds a ISO14443A passive target, then you're good to go!

If you run into `error libnfc.driver.acr122_usb Unable to claim USB interface (Device or resource busy)`,
then [you may need to unload the `pn533` driver](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33790442/6686559). This can be checked
by running `lsmod | grep pn533`. If it's loaded, then you can unload it by running `sudo rmmod pn533`. You might have
to remove `pn533_usb` as well.

### Cracking the keys and reading the data

As it turns out, each sector of the Mifare Classic card can have two different keys: key A and key B. We'll need both
of these keys in order to clone the card fully.

```shell
$ mfoc -O original.mfd
[...]
Auth with all sectors succeeded, dumping keys to a file!
[...]
```

After around 5 minutes, we have the keys and a dump of the card's data in `original.mfd`.

### Writing the data

Now that we have the data, we can write it to a new card.
First, we need to get the keys of the card we're writing to by running `mfoc -O new.mfd`.
Then, we can write the data to the card using `nfc-mfclassic`.

```shell
$ nfc-mfclassic W a u original.mfd new.mfd
[...]
Done, 64 of 64 blocks written.
```

The `W` flag tells `nfc-mfclassic` to write to the card (including block 0, which is normally locked).
Remember that the blank card we bought earlier has a writable UID?
This means that block 0 of the card is writable (going against the standard), making it so that we can clone the card perfectly.
[More on this in this blog post.](https://brandonhinkel.com/2018/08/08/breaking-hardened-mifare-proxmark3.html#why-doesnt-the-card-work)

Now we can try it on a real laundry machine!

![A picture of a blank card showing a balance of $11.50](https://i.imgur.com/xJDXQ4X.jpg)

Even after spending money on the real card, the balance is still the same.

## Profit!

Instead of stopping there, why not try to make the card have any arbitrary balance we want?
To do this, I dumped the original card after I spent some money on it, and checked the difference between
the two dumps.

Before spending, the card had a balance of \$11.50. After spending, the card had a balance of \$9.00.

```diff
$ diff <(xxd original.mfd) <(xxd used.mfd)
5c5
< 00000040: 7e04 0100 81fb feff 7e04 [...]
---
> 00000040: 9d03 0100 62fc feff 9d03 [...]
```

We can see that there are a few bytes that are different between the two cards. Can you guess what the bytes mean?

The first differing two bytes and last differing two bytes represent the balance in cents (little endian).

```
1150 to hex = 047e = 7e 04 (little endian)
 950 to hex = 039d = 9d 03 (little endian)
```

And the second differing byte must be a checksum of some sort - it's actually the bitwise NOT of the balance!

```
0x7e04 ^ 0xffff = 0x81fb
0x9d03 ^ 0xffff = 0x62fc
```

If we want a balance of \$13.37 (1337, 0x0539), then we can set the balance bytes to `39 05` and the checksum to `C6 FA`.

And the result is...
